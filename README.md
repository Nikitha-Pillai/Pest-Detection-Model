# Pest-Detection-Model his project implements an object detection system to identify and classify corn pests in images using the Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50 FPN backbone. 
#Built with PyTorch, the system is trained on a custom COCO-formatted dataset of pest images, leveraging advanced techniques like data augmentation, early stopping, and checkpointing to achieve robust performance. 
#The goal is to assist in agricultural monitoring by accurately detecting pests such as army worms, black cut worms, grubs, mole crickets, peach borers, and red spider mites.
